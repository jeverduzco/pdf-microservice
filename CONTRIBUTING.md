# Contributing to PDF Microservice

First off, thank you for considering contributing to PDF Microservice. It's people like you that make PDF Microservice such a great tool.

## Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the 'main' branch.
  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on main; `git checkout -b fix/main/my_contribution main`. 
  * Please avoid working directly on the `main` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.

## Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to the repository in the OpenAI organization.
* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
